# Problems with OOP

- Inheritence can be problematic, because it can lead to 'spaghetti code' in which there are too many interconnections between objects in your code, to the point where if one thing breaks, it's difficult to fix becuase doing so would break something else, but fixing that would break a third thing, and so on.
- Compartmentalization can cause problems because in some languages, each 'compartment' must associate itself with only one datatype. This leads to confusion because you have to think about both the utility of each compartment or the job it must do, as well as which datatype would be the easiest or best to use based upon the job being done and the limitations or necessities associated with that job.
- Unnecessary complexity can muddle and obscure the inherent order and structure of languages, the unencumbered use of which solves much of the problems that OOP is attempting to solve by adding layer upon layer of additional and ultimately superflous complexity.
- It's important to make sure that programs do one thing and do it well, and that they can work together with other programs to solve more and more complex problems without needing to be rewritten.
