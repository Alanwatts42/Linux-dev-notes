# Linux Dev Notes

<br> 
<br>

## What is this?

This is simply a way for me to consolidate and preserve my notes on using and developing on the linux os through what is likely to be several computer crashes with varying levels of severity and reprecussions (if recent experience is any indication).

## Why here?

First, it's an excuse to get some practice with git, which is never a bad idea given how ubiquitous it has become. Git is surprisingly complex for what it appears to be on the surface, but once you start to figure out what it actually is, the reason for it's complexity rapidly becomes apparent. Also, it's much more convenient than keeping my notes on my computer, and notes stand a better chance of survival on github than in my documents folder.

I don't know what's going to end up in here, but it'll most likely consist mostly of notes in the traditional github style of markdown, and maybe some shell scripts.

If you're still reading this, thank you for your unusual level of interest in a very humble and probably mostly useless repository. If you're a prospective employer, please hire me. 
If you're anyone and everyone else, I left this open for a reason, go ahead and use whatever you want for whatever you want. 
Patent it, package it, slap it on a plastic lunchbox, etc. I have neither the inclination, nor the time, nor the ability, nor the sheer force of will to stop you. However, if you do end up selling a lot of plastic lunchboxes based on something gleaned from here, as unlikely as that may be, I will enthusiastically and graciously accept any money you choose to hurl in my direction.
