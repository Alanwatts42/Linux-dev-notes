# Linux Dev Notes

<br> 
<br>

## What is this?

This is simply a way for me to consolidate and preserve my notes on using and developing on the linux os through what is likely to be several computer crashes with varying levels of severity and reprecussions (if recent experience is any indication).

## Why here?

It never hurts to have an excuse to get better at working with git repositories, given their ubiquity, their incomprehensible documentation (at least past a certain depth of understanding), and deceptively high level of complexity, despite a very easy to understand and ingenious overall premise.

I don't know what's going to end up in here, but it'll most likely consist mostly of notes in the traditional github style of markdown, and maybe some shell scripts.

If you're still reading this, thank you for your unusual level of interest in a very humble and probably mostly useless repository. If you're a prospective employer, please hire me. 
If you're anyone and everyone else, I left this open for a reason, go ahead and use whatever you want for whatever you want. 
Patent it, package it, slap it on a plastic lunchbox, etc. I have neither the inclination, nor the time, nor the ability, nor the sheer force of will to stop you. However, if you do end up selling a lot of plastic lunchboxes based on something gleaned from here, as unlikely as that may be, I will enthusiastically and graciously accept any money you choose to hurl in my direction.
